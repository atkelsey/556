RIP UP AND REROUTE

Use a* for every net you want to rewrite

create maps for a* between 
-point and group
-point and parent(point)
-point and distance(double)
-point and score(double)

use a priority queue
-overwrite comparison functions for scores(higher values are worse) pop these off the queue first

Deciding which nets to rip up
-update scores on fly. if a net is completely uncongested leave it.
